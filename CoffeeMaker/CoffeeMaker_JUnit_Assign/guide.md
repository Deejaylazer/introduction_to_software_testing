### Measures
This file lists important measures taken during project execution:
- Since the project requires Java 8, apply a '-D' flag to all gradle commands
``` 
gradle build -D/path/to/java/8
```

- Delete initial gradle files and generate new gradle wrapper using
``` 
gradle wrapper -D/path/to/java/8
```
