# Efficient Unit Testing with JUnit and Code Coverage with JaCoCo & Mocking with Mockito

The task is to write a test suite (CoffeeMakerTest.java) that effectively tests the [CoffeeMaker class](./Assign/CoffeeMaker_JUnit_Assign/src/main/java/edu/ncsu/csc326/coffeemaker/CoffeeMaker.java). The test suite must also ensure a high level of coverage.

The second task is to mock the behaviour of the RecipeBook class (using Mockito) while testing the rest of the application.

A good implementation of the coffee maker on which all tests should pass is given in *./CoffeeMaker_JUnitGolden*.

A "not-so-good" implementation of the coffee maker on which bugs should be detected is given in *./CoffeeMaker_JUnitGolden*.


## Solution
Task 1: Developed test suite can be found in [CoffeeMakerTest.java](./CoffeeMaker_JUnit_Assign/src/test/java/edu/ncsu/csc326/coffeemaker/CoffeeMakerTest.java).  

Task 2: Developed test suite can be found in [CoffeeMakerTest.java](./CoffeeMaker_Mock_Assign/src/test/java/edu/ncsu/csc326/coffeemaker/CoffeeMakerTest.java).
